Example programs using the Accelerate library. If you add new features to the
base library or find a bug, please add a test case. The aim is for this program
to evolve and be useful for both performance and regression testing.

For a list of available options and test programs, run:
> accelerate-examples --help

If you have found a bug, please report it to:

Adding new backends:
--------------------

Adding support for new Accelerate backends should require only a few minor
additions to the file 'src/Config.hs'. See that file for instructions, and/or
follow the example of the CUDA backend (grep 'ACCELERATE_CUDA_BACKEND').


Backend specific notes:
-----------------------

CUDA: known failures
  * permute-hist: see issue #5
  * slices: `Any` is not implemented yet
  * scanseg-sum: works intermittently
